Title: Large, Sparse Optimal Matching with Refined Covariate Balance
Version: 1.8.6
Date: 2022-2-28
Author: Samuel D. Pimentel
Maintainer: Samuel D. Pimentel <spi@berkeley.edu>
Description: Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units
	and control units in observational studies.  Provisions are
	made for refined covariate balance constraints, which include
	fine and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are 
	optimal in the sense that they are computed as solutions to
	network optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms.
	See Pimentel, et al.(2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879> 
	and Pimentel (2016), Obs. Studies 2(1):4-23.  The optmatch 
	package, which is useful for running many of the provided
	functions, may be downloaded from Github at 
	<https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch> if not available
	on CRAN.
